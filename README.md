# CesarXOR

This is a simple cryptography program that implements encryption and decryption using a combination of the Caesar cipher and XOR encryption. It is designed as a beginner project to explore basic cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts letters in the text by a specified number.
- **XOR Encryption**: Applies a bitwise XOR operation with a user-defined key.
- **Text Input and Output**: Users can input text, specify shift values and keys, and see the encrypted or decrypted output.
- **Clipboard Support**: Users can copy the output to the clipboard and paste text from it.
- **Language Support**: The program supports both Russian and English languages.

## Roadmap

- Rewrite the program in C++ to improve performance and explore different programming paradigms.

## Note

Sorry for any errors; this is my first project. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
